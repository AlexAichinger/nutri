# Read Me First
The following was discovered as part of building this project:

* The JVM level was changed from '22' to '21' as the Kotlin version does not support Java 22 yet.
* The original package name 'com.alexaichinger.nutri-tracking' is invalid and this project uses 'com.alexaichinger.nutri_tracking' instead.
